My name is Martin Akolo Chiteri and I am a Computer programmer from Nairobi.

For two years, 2012 and 2013, I helped in organizing [a local Science event][0] that was being held annually in Nairobi, the Capital city of Kenya. At the same time, I was involved in the planning of [Python][1] and [Open-stack][2]  meet-ups.

In the recent past, my main area of focus has been in building applications for the World-Wide Web. My most favourite authoring tools have been Python, the language interpreter and [django][3], a high-level Web development framework built for it. I have been slowly gravitating towards [Go][4], the server / Cloud infrastructure language. This has mostly been for its better perfomance, excellent concurrency facilities and general pragmatism as a modern language. 

I used to work for [an international I.T firm][8] which specializes in writing and maintaining applications for Utility companies (Water and Electrical power distribution) in the Sub-Saharan region of Africa. That was for five years starting from August 2008 until August 2013. After that I worked with [the largest food assistance (shifting from food aid) organization][9] in the world between January 2014 and end of November 2015. 

I have been extremely fortunate to have been invited to [CERN][5], the European Particle Physics laboratory, to work with [a group of other highly talented Web developers][6] on a project to restore [parts of the original World-wide Web system's server and website][7].

Right now I am a graduate student in [Alberta University's] [10]  department of [Civil & Environmental Engineering] [11]. I am taking a [Master of Science degree] [12] in [Construction Engineering & Management][13] with a heavy bias towards Computer based Simulations and modelling under the supervision of [Dr. AbouRizk] [14].
